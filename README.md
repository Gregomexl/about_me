# about_me
A little project for the Front End Nanodegree.

#Project 0: About Me.

This project is a great opportunity for you to:

Work with the basic structure and syntax of HTML and CSS, which are two of the three languages that go into any website.
Go through the code review process. You will finish the project, submit it, and receive feedback from one of our expert code reviewers. Although the submission process is a bit different from how it will be for your other projects, the idea is same: submit code and get feedback.
Interact with the forums and get to know your classmates.
